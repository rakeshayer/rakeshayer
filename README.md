# NYC Taxi CO2 Emissions Analysis

## Overview
This project conducts an exploratory analysis of the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) dataset to estimate the carbon emissions (CO2) generated by taxi rides in NYC. The analysis focuses on determining trends in emissions based on trip distance, fare, and the number of passengers.

The project uses Databricks for data processing and **Python for visualizing emission patterns. Key insights and recommendations are provided to reduce carbon emissions from NYC taxi rides.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- **Estimate the total CO2 emissions** generated by taxi rides.
- **Compare emissions** based on passenger groups (1-2 passengers vs. 3+ passengers).
- **Visualize emissions trends** over time using appropriate visualizations.
- **Provide recommendations** to reduce emissions from taxi rides.

## Datasets
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the **NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)**. Specifically, the **2018 Yellow Taxi Trip Records** in Parquet format.

- The dataset contains fields such as `trip_distance`, `passenger_count`, `fare_amount`, and `tpep_pickup_datetime`.
- Download the dataset from the official TLC website [here](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).

## Methodology
The analysis follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading**: The 2018 Yellow Taxi Trip data is loaded into a **Spark DataFrame** in Databricks.
   
2. **CO2 Emissions Calculation**:
   - **Fuel consumption** is calculated using the formula:  
     `Fuel Consumed (gallons) = Distance traveled (miles) / 22 MPG`
   - **CO2 emissions** are then calculated using the formula:  
     `CO2 Emissions (kg) = Fuel Consumed (gallons) * 8.89 kg/gallon`

3. **Grouping by Passenger Count**:
   - Trips are classified into two groups:
     - **1-2 passengers**
     - **3+ passengers**
   
4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizations are created to compare the daily CO2 emissions generated by these two passenger groups over time.

## Key Features
- Calculate fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for each taxi ride.
- Aggregate and compare emissions between different passenger groups.
- Visualize total CO2 emissions per day, broken down by passenger count.
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce carbon emissions.
